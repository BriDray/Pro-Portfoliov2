                The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a guide I created
                to help me stay organized for School. Taking a new
                course can be stressful, I wanted to have my important
                notes all in one place to make studying easier and more
                efficient. I learned a lot with this project. I'm totally
                new to coding, so this was a lot of fun to do.

            <p class="projectblurb">Noted is an application designed to help you keep track of your daily life. It comes
                equipped with two APIs which help it do so. These APIs are Open Weather for the current weather
                conditions in a specified area and Spoonacular which has a catalogue of recipes accessed through
                searching keywords. In addition you can write yourself reminders or notes to be referenced.</p>
